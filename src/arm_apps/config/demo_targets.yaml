# Demo targets for arm_apps/demo_sequence
# Format:
# targets:
#   - position: [x, y, z]
#     rpy: [roll, pitch, yaw]
#     # frame_id is optional; defaults to base_link
#
# Note: These are example poses intended for a UR5-like arm in simulation.
# If IK fails, adjust positions/orientations to be within your reachable workspace.
